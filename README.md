The Planetarium Ext
===============

The Planetarium was an (HTML5 + CSS3 + SVG) x JS experiment that was created in 2011 by [Little Workshop](http://www.littleworkshop.fr) for the launch of Firefox 4. It's been featured as a demo in the [Mozilla's Web'O'Wonder](http://demos.mozilla.org) gallery.

**The planetarium Ext** is an attempt to extend the original projet to make it easely translatable and pedagogically usable for a first discovery of the solar system.
